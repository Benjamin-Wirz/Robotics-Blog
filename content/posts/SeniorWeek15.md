This week was a lot of house keeping for the 2 axis stage project. I started the make machining drawings for all of the parts that it needs, as the plan is to start machining after we get back from winter break. This week I also started to work on the coupler that connects the motor to the micrometer, which is pretty boring as its just fiddling with numbers till it fits both.

Outside the shopping cart I milled the last side on Mr. Christy's lamp, as well as starting to work on an engine for Tanzeruls gas powered shopping cart. This has been mostly outside of shop.
