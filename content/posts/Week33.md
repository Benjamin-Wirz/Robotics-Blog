### Lamination Station 

As part of our new upgraded float, we will be making an upgraded Nut Plate. This will be heavily upgaded for strength, as the nut will be bolted on instead, due to an unfortunate failure at regionals the Epoxy joint will not cut it anymore. This means that the joint will be strengthened, and the weakest link would most likely be the bond between the tube and the Nut plate. This is why I am laminating 1/4" acrylic plates, to give us more surface area, and therefore a stronger bond overall. This is so that the nut is still the weakest link, which is fine as it is held in by bolts, which are easily replaceable. 

### Boring Math 

In addition to the upgraded Nut plate, we will be redoing our battery, as it also experienced unfortunate failures. This will come in the form of two PCB's that will replace the resin printed end parts. This should allow us to have a better connection, that is more repairable, and also more reliable. For this, we now need to use KiCad as a CAD software, which is is not built for. This means that I have to do math to figure out where all of the peices should go. to do this, I had to figure out the X and Y offsets, in order to offset it from geometry in an imported DXF. The actual Math is Below. 

### Lathe Work 

To complete the new float, we will also need a second piston. This means that I will be back on the Lathe. Today I only got to facing the end of the stock, and zeroing both axis. Tomorrow I should be able to get to turning the stock to diameter. 

# Tuesday 

### Battery Holder

Yesterday Scott and I were not able to figure all of the stuff out. Today, we ended up just making a new DXF, that actually lines up with the things. This simplifid the work that needed to be done in KiCad, which was nice as KiCad wasn't designed for this type of work in mind. Fortunatly this new stratagy was WAY better, as it was essentally drag and drop onto the new DXF in KiCad. This new battery holder will be so much better as we won't have soley soldered wires connecting everything. The traces and connectors will be much more reliable.
