This week was a little bit of a dissapointment, as we had a snow day. This made it impossible for us test in the water on wednesday. This week I started working on the density calculation in order to see how much weight I had to add. I ran into some issues with figuring out how much volume the float displaced, as 1 cubic millimeter is not a mililiter. Once I got that figured out, I designed a weight system that is very similar to the weights last year, as those worked very well. This year I am using two 1/4 steel plates, and a specially designed 1/8 plate to get us to exactlyish 1.3 kilograms.
