This was an extraordinarily slow week, with only 4 days and a gym period. This week I mainly was working on the lamp project Mr. Christy asked me to machine for him. This was quite time consuming as its a bunch of 14-18 inch long endmill passes in aluminum sheet metal. This was only one side of it so now I have to do it to the other side, and apparently there is a way to make it go much faster. I am also very much thinking about having a sophmore do it, as it is very easy. 

This week I also Water jet out the bracket for the brake actuator. Now all I have to do is to bend it up which I might just stick it in a vice and hit it with a hammer or ask metal fab to bend it which would take like 4 seconds.
