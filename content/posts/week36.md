This week I kept working on building the new float. I got all of the mechanical aspects taken care of, which includes the piston, and the top cap, as well as the whole tube. This just leaves us to go onto the electronics portion of the build. Honestly this week has been pretty boring in terms of blog post content, as i'm really just putting together stuff that I designed months ago  which is still pretty cool, as it still fits and works well, but not the most interesting processes or design challenges at the moment.

The batteries are coming along pretty well, with the PCB's being ordered and I have started to print the middle part thingy. Today I will also pot the antenna, which will make the antenna waterproof.
