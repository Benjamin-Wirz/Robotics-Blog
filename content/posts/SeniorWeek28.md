### Last week

Before break, it was crunch time for our documentation. We needed to re write most of the stuff from last year, and especially re format everything because we were doing it in a different software. I was in charge of the Company Safety review, Job site safety analysis, the SIDs and the Corperate responsibility. We thankfully got everything in on time and everything was good.

During break, we were in from Tuesday to friday. We were mostly fixing the ROV during that time because it kept breaking, but we also got a bit of valuable pool time. 



### Monday

Monday was the day for the marketing display. I took over the theme writing from Jonas, and was finding pictures for it. I was also editing and adding pitcures for the Company Evaluation.

Along with those things, over the break our gripper had broken. This was very unfortunate. To mitigate this I had printed a very oversized version of it. This needed some light manufacturing, so I did that. I milled the bar that is used to pick up items with hooks, using our collet blocks. This was my first time using them and they were very nice. The part was very simple. I needed to put some basic flats on the end and then notch it. Before this part was done using more agressive and less precise tools. I believe this will work much better. Sometimes a little bit of patience goes a long way. 

### Tuesday 

Today we needed to finish the marketing display. After reading the marketing display rubric, Jonas had writen the theme on the complete wrong subject. I quickly rewrote the theme to be a little more correct, and then we proof read the poster and brought it to graphic design to be printed out. 

Because of the odd print settings I choose, I still needed to fix the fit between the Gripper body and the reciever. I did this by simply just sanding and test fitting. The pins are still not fitting though. 

### Wednesday 

By wednesday I had done pretty much everything that I could do for the week at that point. I decided that I wanted to do a small project in the machine shop. I definitely needed a break, but I was ready to go back. I wanted to try knurling, so I though I would just knurl a section of aluminum. Then I had a good idea, of putting a thread on the back, and then using it as a shift knob. I got the thread and then started machining. The knurling took 2 tries to get right, but I didn't have to start over thankfully. After drilling and tapping the hole in the back, it was time to part. I needed to use a longer parting blade to get the reach on the part. This parting blade was much sketchier, especially when the blade height is off, and the speeds and feeds are a bit fast. On the first try The parting blade snapped and shot directly back at me. I was fine but it was a pretty close call. 


### Thursday 

I tried parting the knob off again, but it was being very weird. I decided to use the bandsaw to cut it off and then re chuck and finished the other side. I didnt't want to do this at first because of the loss of centricity, but I lost that after the first parting attempt. It worked much better than I though it would, and I probably should have done that from the beginning.
