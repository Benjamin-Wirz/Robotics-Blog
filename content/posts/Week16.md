This week was quite productive for such a short week. I had two main projects, the battery holder, and the motor holder. Both of  these were things that I already had done the design work for, I just now needed to  print everything out and bolt it together. 

The Battery holder is what I tackled first. I all of this stuff done for about a week, but the main problem was that the 3d printers are incredibly unreliable, and failed 5 times on the print. This being said, I finally got it to work and fot the part. I then put all of the threaded inserts in, and soldered the clips to their leads, and then very carefully assembled everything.
