This saturday is our regional competition. This means that this week was very busy, with practicing and last minute additions and testing. Finally after almost 6 months, we got the float to work, in the water, with depth data comunication. This means that we have maxed out the amount of points that our float can get.

Apart from the float, I discovered that 12th gen stock intel coolers are aweful. In theory I like them, as they are simple to install, however they don't really work. They have these plastic deforming end things that basically never working. We discovered this issue as my friend, Scott Campbell, was working on one of these machines, and his compile times were much longer that those of older machines. He told me that he was getting some sort of warning regarding the cpu cooler so I thought I would take a look. When I got into it, the thing was hanging on my one corner, with a thermal paste aplication that covered about a third of the IHS. I fixed it, but it was a pain to get them all to stick. 

i then learned that these were supposed to be temporary coolers, so I grabbed one of the new ones to put on my machine. So far everything seems to work well, but I haven't really done anything. Hopefully on monday I can walk the rest of the people with the new computers throught how to install these new coolers.
