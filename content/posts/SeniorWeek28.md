### Last week

Before break, it was crunch time for our documentation. We needed to re write most of the stuff from last year, and especially re format everything because we were doing it in a different software. I was in charge of the Company Safety review, Job site safety analysis, the SIDs and the Corperate responsibility. We thankfully got everything in on time and everything was good. 

### Monday

Monday was the day for the marketing display. I took over the theme writing from Jonas, and was finding pictures for it. I was also editing and adding pitcures for the Company Evaluation.
