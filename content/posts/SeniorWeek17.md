This week was a pretty simple week but not that great. I finished up machining the motor plate. That part went pretty smoothly and everything fit together with only a few modifications.

After that I started to machine the base. This was the first part that I used the tormach on by myself, and for that fact everything went really well. The machining of all of the surfaces and the pockets went really well, but when I did all of the drilling, a center drill snapped off in the part, as well as a drill bit. This leaves me with two holes left over, and because they are opposing, it still works. Now I have some facing work on the back, aswell as the top because one of the endmill length offsets was off so the pocket was too deep. Luckily this also doesn't trash the part.
