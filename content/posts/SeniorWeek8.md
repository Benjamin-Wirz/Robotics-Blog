This week was a very good week. I finished up the mechanical assembly for the steering control, aswell as making good progresson tidying up the working golfcarts other retrofits.

Another major issue with the golfcart was the fact that there was exposed high voltage, and wires running through the passenger compartment. This is needless to say, very dagerous, and also very unreliable. After I finished the steering stuff, I essentially relocated the entire throttle control board, re reouting the wires under the frame and making everything fairly neat for the time being. Currently I have one of the Sophmores making me a box, as its both a good starting project and Im lazy, but in the short term Im just going to make a little backing plate that we can velcro down somewhere and secure it.
