### Monday 

This monday I ran the first operation on the wallet. This was pretty un eventful, but I ended up putting a nasty bend in the part. Because it is mostly decorational, I don't really want to completely re do it because of it. I ended up not really realizing it till the next day, so I couldn't really fix it.

### Tuesday

On tuesday I ran the second operation. I still put a decent bend in it the other way, but I was a lot softer with the vice, so it was considerably less noticeable. I'm not really happy with the bowing, but re doing it would be a significant amount of work. 



### Wednesday 

Wednesday was a lot harder because I made the clip. This was a lot more difficult than any machining I have ever done. Sheet metal is difficult. I had to make my own stamp, in order to get the bend around the back to be good, and it worked surprisingly well. Then I just bent everything into the general shape and it was pretty good.

After school, I cleaned out the Tormach. It despretly needed it after the wallet. I used a lot of coolant.

### Thursday

Thursday I started on figuring out some of the basic electronics like motor controlers for the steering and braking on the golf cart.
