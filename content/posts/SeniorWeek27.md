This week I Worked on the Limit switch mounts 

### Monday 

I started monday by figuring out what needed to be done on the golf cart. I figured that we would need limit switches, and that is in my wheelhouse. I selected the switches that I wanted to use. These were switches that we had pulled off a robotic arm earlier in the year, and are pretty satifysing to click. To start I went out to the vehicle and though of how I could actually mount it up. I came up with an idea, but the clearance was going to be tight.

### Tuesday 

Tuesday started off from where I left off on monday.  I started by taking some rough measurements. I have a very large target that I need to hit so it doesn't have to be perfect. I am also going to design a lot of adjustment into the mount. I then modeled up a quick bracket in CAD using the sheet metal tab.

Alongside that, the shopping cart is finally getting its roll cage. I helped out [Tanerul Azam](https://tazam257.wixsite.com/tanzerul-azam) with some simulations to figure out if the cage that he designed would be strong enough. I did this with the simulations workspace on fusion 360

### Wednesday 

Wednesday I cut out the bracket on the the waterjet and using our new brake, I bent it up. Getting the brake set up was a challenge that nearly saw my hand get crushed. This required 4 people uprighing it. It was very sketchy. After that I had to figure out how to make it bend 1/8 inch steel. I did this very sketchily by spacing out the bottom teeth with a washer. I would not recommend this, but it works. I realized that there was no way that these dimensions would work, so I had to try again and this time it worked much better

### Thursday 

Due to inclament weather, I was unable to test and modify the bracket on Thursay. This has been pushed back a day to Friday. What did happen on thursday was the preparation for the roll cage on the shopping cart. The was all paint removal, because it is really hard to weld through this paint.
