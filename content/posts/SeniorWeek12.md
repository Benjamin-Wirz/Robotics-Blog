This week was very productive. On friday. I was able to bend and fully assemble the bracket for the Linear Actuator. This was pretty simple as it was one part that needed two bends which was simple enough and then on Monday I had to drill out the hole to fit the 5/16ths cotter pin thing that It pivots around. Origionally I had wanted to use a simple shoulder bolt, however we had these in the Shop and they are plenty good.

Next I had to turn the simple pin that would connect the other end of the linear actuator to the pedal. This is basically a little sheath to a screw that transfers the motion to the pedal. Im not sure if its good because its kind of small, and there are relatively large forces going through it, but it didn't take very long to make, and we will see.
