      <description>Quick disclaimer, I am not an experienced web developer, or programer of any kind, there are probably 10 better ways to do this but I am not aware of them. Excuse my probably incorrect terminology.
As you can see this website is based off of the fairly popular Hugo theme hello-friend by panr. I am a large fan of this theme, however I wanted to customize it, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the lack of a title seperate from the header at the top of the page.</description>
