This week was all about fitting the Hub onto the Shaft which was completely achieved. I started by trying to file it down, which worked to an extent, but eventually it was just going way to slow. What I ended up doing is bringing the dremel outside and hogging off the rest of the material. This worked really well, and made it so that I was able to slide the thing most of the way over the splines, with some small amounts of bashing, and wedging with a screw driver.

Now what I can do is start to reduce the diameter a little more to try and make the bearing a bit easier to seat. Im somewhat hoping that I don't actually have to split the bearing which would make my life significantly easier. After that I can figure out how much chain I actually need and reduce its length. Im not sure I need a chain tensioner but if I do, I don't think it will be too hard.
