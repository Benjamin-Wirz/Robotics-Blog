This week I continued working on the locking mechanism, and assembling it for pool testing, which we did yesterday. All of the new parts are working great, but I had to reprint the reciever side of the tool, because of the bolts being in the way of the locking pin. This extended the time that it took to do this, which was quite annoying, but it is done now so i'm not complaining. This locking mechanism works great, so we will continue to use it, aswell as on some other critical tools, which can see some of these stresses.

In float news, the depth sensor is working finally, but we now need to get everthing to work well together, as it has started acting up again. We thing there is a couple of issues with the electronics, which makes sense as neither of us are particularly skilled in this area. To combat the slight leak I decided to fully epoxy the inside of the connector. Which should eliminate many of the problems we have been having. If this becomes a problem again, then I will do the same thing, but to the top.
