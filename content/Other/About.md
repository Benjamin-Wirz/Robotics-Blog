![Picture of me working on a tank base](/AboutPic.JPG)

As a junior in the class of 2025, I am in the Medford Vocational Technical Highschool's Robotics and Engineering shop, where I have taken a special interest in CAD (Fusion360), and Machining, however I also enjoy the software side, where I mainly use Python and Arduino. I have also been a part of Sunk Robotics, the robotics team out of the robotics and engineering shop, where I designed multiple parts critical to the success of the team. This June We placed 14th in our second-ever year of operation.

For approximately 4 years I have been a part of the model aviation community where I learned to love aviation and many skills that I use daily in the Robotics and Engineering shop. I have built and flown just about everything, from fixed-wing aircraft to multi-rotors.
