This week was a pretty big week. It was our first pool test and first water test. The outcomes of both of these were very good as nothing broke and we were able to dial in the weights, and the super unreliable hall effect sensors. This testing also brought along multiple new ideas, which were using two hall effect sensors, and changing the voltage that the hall effect sensors run on. 

The idea for the new hall effect senors is to put another sensor on the other side of the plunger, so offset 180 degrees, in order to futher differentiate in hardware where the piston is in the tube. I started drilling these holes, and a tap may or may not have snapped in the hole.
