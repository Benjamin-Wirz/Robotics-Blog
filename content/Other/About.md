As a junior in the class of 2025, I am in the Medford Vocational Technical Highschool's Robotics and Engineering shop, where I have taken a special interest in CAD (Fusion360), and Machining, however I also do enjoy the software side, where I mainly use Python and Arduino. I have also been a part of Sunk Robotics, the robotics team, where I designed multiple parts critical to the success of the team. This June we placed 14th in the world championships in longmont colarado, in our second-ever year of operation.

For approximately 4 years I have been a part of the model aviation community where I learned to love aviation and many skills that I use daily in the Robotics and Engineering shop. I have built and flown just about everything, from fixed-wing aircraft to multi-rotors, but have mainly flown FPV racing drones, although I am looking to get into some more fixed wing flight.
