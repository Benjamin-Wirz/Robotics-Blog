      <description>This past week has been rough as it&amp;rsquo;s our first almost full week back in shop and it is fairly hot with super high humidity to go along with it. In the shop I have been primarily working on the fish feeder for the biotech shop here in the voc. I have also been working on this website which has been pretty frustrating and rewarding.
The fish feeder was originally built by students before my time, and its main purpose is to feed the fish that the biotech shop has automatically.</description>
