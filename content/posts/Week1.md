This past week has been rough as its our first almost full week back in shop and it is fairly hot with super high huminity to go along with it. In shop I have been primarily working on the fish feeder for the biotech shop here in the voc. I have also been working on this website which has been pretty frustrating and rewarding. 

The fish feeder was origionally built by students before my time, and its main purpose is to feed the fish that the biotech shop has automatically. It is in for a bit of matenince at the moment because the auger used to deliver the fish food broke. This isn't the first time this issue has occured, as last year myself and another student repaired the auger. This time things will be a bit different, as we will be fully printing a new one instead of jb welding the old one together.
