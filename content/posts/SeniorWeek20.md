This week was exactly like every other week this year, more and more machining. 

### Friday 

On friday I finished up the pins I made, this wasn't very much special, but because we don't have a 1/4" 5C collet (We now do don't worry) I had to get creative and put my pins in a mill tool holder and then that into a collet that we did have. While being unorthodox it was surprisingly normal and effective.

### Monday 

After finishing the pins last week I noticed that it wasn't possible to screw the bolts into the threads. This couldve been for a few reasons. Either I used the wrong tap, the wrong drill bit, or the wrong screws. So I tried the first thing. I re tapped one and it seemed to work much better. Then I tried using a different tap and that worked even better. I later looked at what drill I was using and it was incorrect. People really have to start putting the drill back correctly, and maybe I should really look at what drills I am using. After this I was able to start getting everything setup for a new base that I need to cut. This was very boring as it entailed very long bandsaw cuts as well as lots of tool indexing and offsets. 

### Tuesay 

On Tuesday I cut the new base. This was exactly like the old base, except the holes are now threaded so I can utilize the intended mounting solution, as well as there not being any drill bits embeded in it. Luckily the CNC work was all uneventful however long and annoying. I did create quite the challenge for myself. I didn't leave enough room to hold onto the material in the horizontal bandsaw, meaning I had to remove the material by turning it into chips. This isn't the end of the world but also gave me an opportunity to use a new process I had done before. 

### Wednesday 

Wednesday I had a lot of material to remove. This I chose to do with a big roughing endmill. I had never done this before so it was pretty interesting. At first I was running the HSS mill about 4 times faster than I should have, at about 1000 rpm. Even though it wasn't optimal it still worked really well at removing large amounts of material.

After the roughing, I still had to face it to width and drill and tap the holes for the mounting. This went off without a hitch and honestly is not very entertaining.

Now with this done I was able to assemble the thing for the first time. Unfortunatly I lost one of the pins, but otherwise, everything works perfectly!

### Thursay 

SNOW DAY!
